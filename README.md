#Click History

A proof of concept that displays incoming data (via json) and streams the information after being processed by a buffer. This was tasked at a retargeted advertisement company who had recently implemented their databases to be accessed asyncronously. 

This app was to retrieve the information relating to advertisements that were being clicked and display them in real time.
